**Description Popup**

When the length of the description text is longer than the configured length to be displayed, an "icon" is placed at the end of the truncated description text to indicate that are more text.  When the user hover the mouse over that icon, a popup appears to display the complete content of the description text.  The following settings control the length and width of that popup screen.

The default size of the popup is:
```
$wgPageAttachment_descriptionPopupWidth  = '50em';
$wgPageAttachment_descriptionPopupHeight = '7em';
```
