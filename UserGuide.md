**WORK IN PROGRESS**

**Brought over verbiage from issue# 49 as a starting point**

If there are no errors during installation then you should see an empty attachment box with buttons at the top right (if right-to-left language, at the top left) corner: upload+attach and browse/search+attach buttons, at the least, based on your configuration.

**Case 1:** If you use the upload+attach button to upload a file, after the upload is complete, the uploaded file would be attached to the page from where you initiated the action -- you don't need to do anything else.

**Case 2:** If you use the browse/search+attach button, you would be provided with a page that shows existing files on the wiki in a table format and the last column would have a click-able paperclip image to attach the file -- when you click it, the file would attached to the page from where you initiated the action -- you don't need to do anything else.

For both case 1 & 2, when the attach action completes, the wiki displays the page from where you initiated the action and the attachment list box should show the attached file -- if something goes wrong, an error message would be displayed.
